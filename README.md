# CSC482-final-project
For this final project, we decided to create a website application to detect a genre of a song based on its lyrics. We are choosing to do this project because there is huge data of lyrics on the Internet that we can work on. Also, this is an open project which means beside detecting the Genre, in the future we can do more interesting things related to this such as the style of an artist or the changing of modern music.
